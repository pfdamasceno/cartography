# cartography

- Cartography is a collaborative, curated list of brain atlases. It is based on [Andreas Horn's](http://andreas-horn.de) detailed [collection of cortical atlas parcellations](http://www.lead-dbs.org/helpsupport/knowledge-base/atlasesresources/cortical-atlas-parcellations-mni-space).

- If you know of an atlas not currently in this list, feel free to fork this repository, include the missing atlas, and submit a Pull Request.
